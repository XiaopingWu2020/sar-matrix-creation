# sar-matrix-creation
This is a matlab toolbox for creating SAR matrices given the electromagnetic simulations of a multi-channel transmit RF coil. 
You may run the demo script, `demo.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to create both voxel and local SAR matrices. 
The example simulation data used in the demo were generated by Alireza using CST.
